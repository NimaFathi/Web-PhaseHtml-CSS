                    Actually I was born in a small city called Bojnourd in the east side of my country.<br>
                    My family was there because my father was on doctor things for needy people in small cities<br>
                    (it's a law for doctors in our country for very first years of their ways).<br>
                    after that we moved to Tehran and then come back to my birthplace once again at the age of 7.<br>
                    Then in our iterative journey we moved to Tehran again.
